# Docker Basics — Day 1

## What is Docker?
A platform that allows you to build, run, and ship applications inside containers.

## Key Concepts
- Image → a packaged application
- Container → a running instance of an image
- Dockerfile → file used to build images
- Docker Hub → public image registry

## Basic Commands
- docker --version  
- docker pull <image>  
- docker run <image>  
- docker ps  
- docker stop <container>  
- docker rm <container>

## Notes
- Containers are lightweight and portable.
- Docker eliminates the "works on my machine" problem.
